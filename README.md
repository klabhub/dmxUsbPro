# Enttec DMX USB Pro
This repository contains code to interface with an Enttec DMX USB Pro device. 
(This device communicates, for instance, with  light fixtures or sound devices using the DMX512 protocol that is a standard in the audiovisual tech world).

Dependencies:

1. The class uses the serialouput object which was introduced in Matlab R2019b
2. I connect the serialoutput object to a COM port. That is (probably?) Windows only.
3. You should install one of the software packages that Enttec provides first (EMU is the current fancy software, but the older, more basic Pro-Manager works just as well for our purpose here). You can download either one from [Enttec's Website](https://support.enttec.com/support/solutions/articles/101000394255-usb-dmx-compatible-usb-software).
